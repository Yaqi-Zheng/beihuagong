## Additional Requirements

## Notice
### Committing your work
As you work you should demonstrate good use of Git, our version control system. By “good” we mean that you should commit small, incremental changes and use meaningful commit messages.

Incremental changes mean that each commit should focus on a single issue, feature, or addition to your solution. For example, if you implement five new features then it is poor to commit all your changes in a single large commit. Instead, you should commit five times, with each commit containing all the changes for a single feature.

Commit messages should consist of a brief one-line summary and an optional, more detailed explanation separated by an empty line. For example, one commit message might be:

>Added CSS for rounded corners on the buttons.
>TA’s suggestion. TA is HCI major. :-)

The first line of the commit message is similar to an email subject, and the optional explanation is like the body of an email message.
